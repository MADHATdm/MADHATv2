# MADHAT2
Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool V2

MADHAT 2.0 places bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section through a Fermi-LAT-data-based, model-independent analysis of dark matter annihilation into gamma rays within dwarf galaxies/dwarf-like objects. The tool features improved sensitivity to dark matter models relative to version 1.0 via photon weighting by dwarf galaxy of origin and energy.

Please note: The version of madhat2.py currently present on this repository contains an issue: the use of the term "filepath" vs "filename". The [Running MADHAT](https://github.com/MADHATdm/MADHATv2/wiki/Running-MADHAT) section of the Wiki currently reflects this issue to an extent. A corrected version of the code will hopefully be uploaded by the end of October 13, 2023. I apologize for any inconvenience!
